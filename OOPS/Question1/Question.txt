Enterprise User Session Management System
Question Description

A large enterprise application wants to track user login sessions internally.

The system must clearly distinguish between:

Application-level initialization

Object creation

User-specific data handling

System Behavior
When the application starts:

A message must be printed once indicating that the session system is ready.

Each time a user session is created:

A session object should automatically log its creation

User-specific details must be initialized

The total number of active sessions must increase

Requirements

Create a class named UserSession.

Use a static initializer block to print:

Session System Initialized


Each session object must store the following non-static data members:

userId

userName

Maintain a static variable to track the total number of active sessions.

Use an instance initializer block to print:

New Session Object Created


Use a constructor to:

Initialize userId and userName

Increment the total session count

Create a non-static method to display:

userId

userName

In the main class:

Create session objects using hardcoded data

Display session details

Print the total number of active sessions

Hardcoded Data Set to Use
User ID   User Name
1         Admin
2         Developer

Expected Output
Session System Initialized
New Session Object Created
New Session Object Created
1 Admin
2 Developer
Total Sessions: 2
