========================
Travel Booking System
(Using Constructor Overloading and Inheritance)
========================

------------------------
Problem Statement
------------------------
Design and implement a Travel Booking System that manages ticket bookings
for passengers travelling by train or flight using object-oriented concepts.

------------------------
System Description
------------------------
- Every booking is associated with a passenger
- Each booking has a base ticket price
- Passengers can:
  1. Book only a ticket
  2. Book a ticket with seat selection
  3. Book a ticket with seat selection and meal service
- Premium bookings provide additional premium services

------------------------
Rules and Conditions
------------------------
- Constructor overloading must be used to create different types of bookings
- Inheritance must be used to represent PremiumBooking (IS-A Booking)
- All price-related variables must be encapsulated
- Premium service charge is added only if total booking cost exceeds 3000
- The system must display passenger details and final booking cost

------------------------
Class: Passenger
------------------------
Variable:
- name : String

Constructor:
- Passenger(String name)

Method:
- getName() : String

------------------------
Class: Booking
------------------------
Private Variables:
- basePrice : double
- seatCharge : double
- mealCharge : double
- passenger : Passenger

Overloaded Constructors:
- Booking(Passenger passenger, double basePrice)
- Booking(Passenger passenger, double basePrice, double seatCharge)
- Booking(Passenger passenger, double basePrice, double seatCharge, double mealCharge)

Methods:
- getTotalCost() : double
- displayBooking() : void

------------------------
Class: PremiumBooking
------------------------
(extends Booking)

Private Variable:
- premiumCharge : double

Overloaded Constructors:
- PremiumBooking(Passenger passenger, double basePrice, double premiumCharge)
- PremiumBooking(Passenger passenger, double basePrice, double seatCharge,
                 double mealCharge, double premiumCharge)

Method:
- getTotalCost() : double
  (Adds premium charge only if total cost exceeds 3000)

------------------------
UML Relationship
------------------------
Passenger  <----  Booking  <----  PremiumBooking

------------------------
Hardcoded Data Used
------------------------

Passenger 1:
- Name: Ravi
- Base Price: 2000
- Seat Charge: 300

Passenger 2:
- Name: Anita
- Base Price: 2500
- Seat Charge: 400
- Meal Charge: 300
- Premium Charge: 500

------------------------
Execution Flow
------------------------
1. Create Passenger Ravi
2. Create Booking with base price and seat charge
3. Calculate and display total booking cost

4. Create Passenger Anita
5. Create PremiumBooking with seat, meal, and premium charges
6. Add premium charge since total cost > 3000
7. Display final booking cost

------------------------
Expected Output
------------------------
Passenger: Ravi
Total Booking Cost: 2300.0

Passenger: Anita
Total Booking Cost: 3700.0
