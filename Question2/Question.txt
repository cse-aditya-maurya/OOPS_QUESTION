University Student Management System
Scenario: University Student Record Management

You are tasked with building a Student Management System for a university.
The system must manage individual student data as well as university-wide statistics, demonstrating the proper use of static and non-static members in Object-Oriented Programming.

System Requirements
1. University-Level Requirements (Static Context)

The University class must manage global university data.

Static Variables

totalStudents → initial value: 0

UNIVERSITY_CODE → constant value: "UNI-2024"

currentAcademicYear → initial value: "2024-2025"

minPassingGrade → initial value: 2.0

Static Methods

displayUniversityInfo()
Displays all university statistics

updateAcademicYear(String newAcademicYear)
Updates the academic year

isPassingGrade(double gpa)
Returns true if gpa ≥ minPassingGrade

getTotalStudents()
Returns total number of students

Static Initializer Block

Print the following messages when the class is loaded:

University class loaded and initialized
Setting up university system...

2. Student-Level Requirements (Non-Static Context)

The Student class must manage individual student data.

Instance Variables

studentId → auto-generated as "STU-" + sequential number starting from 1000

name

major

gpa

coursesEnrolled

Static Variable

nextStudentNumber → initial value: 1000

Non-Static Methods

displayStudentInfo()
Displays complete student information

updateGPA(double newGrade, int creditHours)
Updates GPA after receiving a new grade

enrollCourse(int creditHours)
Enrolls student in a course

isOnDeansList()
Returns true if GPA ≥ 3.5

Constructors

Student(String name, String major)

Student(String name, String major, double initialGpa)

Initializer Blocks

Static Initializer:

Student class loaded and initialized


Instance Initializer:

Creating a new student object...


Also initialize:

coursesEnrolled = 0

gpa = 0.0

Main Method Execution Flow

Display the system title

Call University.displayUniversityInfo() before creating any objects

Create three student objects using the following data:

1. Alice Johnson | Computer Science | No initial GPA
2. Bob Smith     | Mathematics      | Initial GPA: 3.2
3. Carol Davis   | Physics          | Initial GPA: 3.8


Perform student operations:

Alice enrolls in 3 credit hours → GPA updated to 3.7

Bob enrolls in 4 credit hours → GPA updated to 3.9

Carol enrolls in 3 credit hours → GPA updated to 3.6

Display individual student information

Update academic year to "2025-2026"

Test passing grade validation for GPA values 1.5 and 2.5

Compare static vs instance data:

Total students (static)

Courses enrolled by individual students (instance)

Display final university information
